The goal of this programming assignment is to  
1) Try how to preprocess a text dataset for
sentiment classication, 2) implement an old-school basic language model, Bi-Gram, 3)
understand the concept of classical neural network for text, RNN, 4) get a taste of a complete
supervised learning process, and 5) compare the results and performance with SOTA method
(DistilBert in this assignment). Please make sure you understand the concept of n-gram,
recurrent neural network and BERT before working on this assignment.
