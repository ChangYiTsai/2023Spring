# Introduction 
The goal of this assignment is to 
1) be more familiar with hw2 and DistilBert, and
2) get a 
taste of explainable AI techniques and attacks in NLP.  
We provide a sample code (hw4.ipynb). It is fine to implement other explainable 
techniques, add additional functions or do some modifications if you need them. Feel 
free to ask any questions in the forum.
