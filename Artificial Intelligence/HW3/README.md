# Pac-Man Game
## Introduction
 For those of you not familiar with Pac-Man, itâ€™s a game where pacman (the yellow circle
 with a mouth) moves around in a maze and tries to eat as many food pellets (the small
 white dots) as possible, while avoiding the ghosts (the other two agents with eyes). If
 pacman eats all the food in a maze, it wins. The big white dots are capsules, which give
 pacman power to eat ghosts in a limited time. You can play this game directly here to get
 familiar with the game.
 In this assignment, you will design agents for the simple version of Pac-Man. The goal of
 this programming assignment is to learn how to  
 1) implement minimax search and
 expectimax search,
2) implement a basic reinforcement learning model (i.e.,
 Q-learning), and
3) compare the results and performance with the deep reinforcement
 learning model (i.e., DQN provided in this assignment). Please make sure you
 understand the concept of adversarial search and reinforcement learning before working
 on HW3.
 The code base of Pac-Man was developed by UC Berkeley.
